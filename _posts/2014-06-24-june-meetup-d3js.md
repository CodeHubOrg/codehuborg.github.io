At our June meetup, Duncan took us from first steps in using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) for creating svg elements and simple charts through to creating a [force layout diagram](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout), which involves some more elaborate code. 

The example below uses data taken from the [Mood Panda](http://www.moodpanda.com/) app and visualises the number of interactions between members.

Duncan's tutorial is available on the CodeHub GitHub repository: [github.com/CodeHubOrg/d3-workshop](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/d3-workshop). It uses Node to set up a local server and express site. Then you uncomment and manipulate the d3.js code in the files bit by bit, and view the results in the browser.
