In this presentation [Edan Kwan](https://twitter.com/edankwan) showed many techniques that are used in advanced frontend animation, from the basics to the very powerful:

- Interpolation 
- Tween Engines 
- Canvas effects 
- Basic GLSL (Using THREE.JS and/or PIXI.JS) 
- Optimization 
- How to be a better front-end developer

He went through a lot of examples and did some dizzying live coding. Check out some great examples in the slides.
