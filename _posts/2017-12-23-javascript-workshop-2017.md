On 24 September 2017 we organised a day of JavaScript workshops, like we did before in 2014 and 2015 (and Bristol JS in 2013).

It was a really nice day where everybody got chatting, the venue near TempleStation was ideal, and we had four great talks. You can find the links to slides and materials below. 

- **Alex Jones - Angular (2/4) Fundamentals**     
          
    Slides with instructions to build Robot Army App: [http://slides.com/alex-jones/deck](http://slides.com/alex-jones/deck)  
    
- **Denis Sellu - Intro to hybrid apps with Ionic 3**

- **Liv Franzen - Coding in three dimensions - an introduction to WebVR**  
                                                  
    Instructions with link to repo: [https://tailless.github.io/webvr/](https://tailless.github.io/webvr/)           
    For VR examples, you need an Android Phone with Google VR Services app installed ( requires Android OS version 6+ Marshmallow and gyroscope )
                        
We also had a panel where four developers (Liv Franzen, Bridget McErlean, David Moody and Simon Capet) answered questions from the audience. 

Many thanks to all the speakers. We are also grateful to our sponsors, [OnCorps](http://oncorps.io/), who made this event possible.
