At our April meet-up Rob took us through installing and building a small site with the static site generator [DocPad](http://docpad.org). It is built on node an the express framework and has an impressive list of features. It can also be extended via plugins, which enables you to build the site with the tools you are already used to. 

We also looked at CSS Animations with keyframe rules and transforms, and created a flying buiscuit!
