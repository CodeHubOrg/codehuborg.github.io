In this presentation and workshop, [Phil Pearce](https://twitter.com/philpearce) showed how to use JSON-LD to provide structured information about a website's content and improve SEO. He gave many practical examples that enabled people to get started with adding JSON-LD to a site right away.    

JSON-LD (Linked data based on the JSON format) allows you to use structured data on your website without having to embed it in your markup. While it has officially been recommended by [schema.org](http://schema.org) since 2013, support by Google has significantly grown from the start of 2015.
