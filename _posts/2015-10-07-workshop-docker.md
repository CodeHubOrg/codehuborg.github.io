Following on from the [Vagrant workshop](http://codehuborg.github.io/vagrant/provisioning/workshop/2015/03/12/workshop-vagrant.html) three weeks earlier, [Richard Wall](http://twitter.com/wallrj) introduced Docker, software that allows you to package, deploy, and run applications with the help of containers. Docker is sometimes pitched against Vagrant when in fact they can be used together (see [this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16647069/should-i-use-vagrant-or-docker-io-for-creating-an-isolated-environment) with comments from the authors of Vagrant and Docker)

This was another hands-on workshop and gave a great introduction into what you can do with Docker. You can go through the tutorial on your own, cloning the git repo that Richard put together (see link below). The slides give a brief and clear introduction to the different types of virtualisation that tools like Vagrant, Puppet and Chef provide, and on the other hand Docker.

- There used to be an interactive tutorial teaching you the most common Docker commands, but it seems to have disappeared off the Internet! But this self-paced training might be a good replacement: [https://training.docker.com/self-paced-training](https://training.docker.com/self-paced-training)
