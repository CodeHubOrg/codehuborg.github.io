Our second evening workshop was on Testing. Tom Buckley-Houston gave an introduction into the philosophy and the principles behind testing in software development, as well as giving many live coding examples. I really liked the analogy, that testing is, in a way, as "necessary" as friends are.

You can run most of the examples in the browser in jsFiddle. But even if you don't want to try out the examples, the Readmes are in this case really worth reading! They will give you a lot of background knowledge on testing.
