With increasing browser support, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is finally becoming a valid option for creating images that can scale without loss across multiple viewport sizes.

There are a number of areas where SVG can be useful, for example: 

+ Icons that can be styled with css
+ Generated graphs and other diagrams like pie charts, columns charts
+ Animated images


In this workshop we will look at the anatomy of svg images and see an example of how they can be manipulated.
