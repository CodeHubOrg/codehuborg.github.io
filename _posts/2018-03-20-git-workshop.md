 At the end of November 2017, Oli Ward gave a Git workshop which was hosted at [DevelopMe](https://developme.training/), the web development training company he runs. It was a great opportunity for those not very familiar or confident with Git to get an in-depth look into the fundamental commands and workflows. More seasoned users could still pick up some previously unknown details, and contributed some knowledge as well. 

I just become aware that we have come full circle with this, as the first evening workshop we ever did was on Git as well. There were also  two inbetween, making it the technology we've covered most! The workshops all differed a lot from each other, which goes to show what a multi-faceted topic it is. From basic commands, you can go to workflows, the internals of Git, lifecycles of files to a debate about the ability to "change history".

This will be my last entry on this blog. We have not decided when we will organise the next workshop, and I will anyway stop writing about them here - we might find a different way to document them. 

In any case, it has been an amazing four years so far, and I cannot express how grateful I am to everybody who gave up their time to make these workshops happen, most of all those who created and delivered them!
