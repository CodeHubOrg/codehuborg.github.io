This is where we are going to document what we did at each meeting. Everybody who gives a presentation can contribute to this site.

### How to add posts

Posts are published by pushing a markdown file to the \_posts directory in our [GitHub Pages repository](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/codehuborg.github.io) You need to name the file in the YYYY-MM-DD-title.md format . At the top of the file you can add the title and categories. 

For example this page has in its front matter: 
{% highlight bash %}
layout: post
title: GitHub Pages
categories:
- github
- jekyll
{% endhighlight %}
<p>&nbsp;</p>
