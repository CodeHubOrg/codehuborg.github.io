In November of 2014 Jeff Schomay ran a HTML5 games workshop, in which he demonstrated how to make a Shooter game with [PhaserJS](http://phaser.io/). 

Jeff covered a lot of code in this session, and ended up with a [very slick game](http://jsbin.com/humivu/27/).

Jeff has published the tutorial on his site, you can find the steps to create the game here: 

[Part 1 – Setting up the player and world](http://codeperfectionist.com/articles/phaser-js-tutorial-building-a-polished-space-shooter-game-part-1/)   
[Part 2 – Power up the player’s ship](http://codeperfectionist.com/articles/phaser-js-tutorial-building-a-polished-space-shooter-game-part-2/)    
[Part 3 – Adding enemies](http://codeperfectionist.com/articles/phaser-js-tutorial-building-a-polished-space-shooter-game-part-3/)       
[Part 4 – Pacing](http://codeperfectionist.com/articles/phaser-js-tutorial-building-a-polished-space-shooter-game-part-4/)   
[Part 5 – Boss level!](http://codeperfectionist.com/articles/phaser-js-tutorial-building-a-polished-space-shooter-game-part-5/)     

As an additional treat, Richard Davey, the creator of Phaser, was at the event to answer questions about Phaser. He talked about the day to day development work, creating games for the BBC, the challenges of testing, the beginning of Phaser and its upcoming features and products built on it ([Cbbc\'s Technobabble Game Maker](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/games/make-it-technobabble-game-maker) and a new version of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)).
